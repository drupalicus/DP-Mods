How to use Views Node Feed:

1. Install Views Node Feed at admin/build/modules
2. Go to admin/settings/views_node_feed and create a node
   feed to specify the format your feed will be in.
3. Create a view that you will use to populate your feed
   with nodes. You can sort and filter these nodes just
   as you regularly would with views. The view should provide
   a page.
4. Add a "Feed" display by selecting "Feed" in the dropdown
   at the upper left and then clicking "Add Display"
5. Click "Style" in the basic settings column of your new feed 
   and select "Views Node Feed" at the bottom of the page.
   Click "Update"
6. There should be a Settings icon next to "Style: Views Node Feed"
   in the "Basic Settings" column.  Click that icon and select your feed. 
   **Remember to click both "Update" and then "Save"**
7. Go to the path you specified and view your feed!

Note: views_node_feed no longer requires the /node_feed argument in order 
to function.  The path you specified will work as specified
